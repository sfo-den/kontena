# Kontena Image Registry

Kontena has built-in support for creating private Image Registry. The Image Registry may be used to store Docker images used by your own application. The registry is running in your [Grid](grids.md) so you'll have total control over the access control, security and distribution of your images. Kontena Image Registry is based on [Docker Image Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/).

Kontena may be used with any Docker Image Registry. Users looking for a zero maintenance, ready-to-go solution are encouraged to check [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/account/signup/) or [Quay](https://quay.io/) who provide a hosted Registry, plus some advanced features.

You should use the Kontena's built-in Image Registry if you want to:

* Have total control where your images are being stored
* Fully own your images distribution pipeline
* Ensure access control and security for your own Docker images
