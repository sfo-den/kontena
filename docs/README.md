# Kontena Documentation

Using container technologies, such as Docker, can be tricky at large scale deployments. Kontena makes it very easy to deploy, manage, scale and monitor containerized applications on any cloud infrastructure. 

The design and architecture of Kontena software is built to provide support for various application container technologies. At the moment, only [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) is supported but expect to see support for technologies like [CoreOS Rocket](https://github.com/coreos/rocket) and more in the future.

Kontena software is open source, and you can use it for any purpose, personal or commercial.

This documentation is a work in progress, so any feedback or requests are welcome at info@kontena.io. Please use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kontena/docs/issues) to report any documentation mistakes. You may also contribute to documentation by doing a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
